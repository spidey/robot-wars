| # | Description | Status |
|---|-------------|--------|
|	1	 |	Find in code (or write from scratch) the logic that activates front LED lights	 |	Done	 |
|	bonus	 |	Get LED lights to flash in MORSE CODE the word ADYEN. 1 color per letter:  A:red, D:yellow, Y:green, E:turquoise, N:blue	 |	Done	 |
|	2	 |	Get the car to drive in a perfect square of 1 meter each direction	 |	Done	 |
|	bonus	 |	Drive car in specific sequence to form the word TECH	 |	Done	 |
|	3	 |	Have the car react to hand signs (go, stop, turn...)	 |	Incomplete	 |
|	bonus	 |	Have different hand signs react to specific commandags	 |	Incomplete	 |
|	4	 |	Have the car run parallel to a wall	 |	Done	 |
|	bonus	 |	If the car angles left or right, have it correct it's path by measuring distance to the wall with the camera or sensors	 |	Done	 |
|	5	 |	Use the car to compute the surface of a room/area	 |		 |
|	bonus	 |	Use the measurements to automatically generate a map of the room	 |		 |
|	6	 |	Use the car to search and find an specific object in the room/area	 |		 |
|	bonus	 |	Get the bot to push the object into a specifically calculated corner	 |		 |
|	7	 |	Have the car follow a specific color	 |		 |
|	bonus	 |	Have the car recognize the color and flash its lights multiple times in the same color	 |		 |
|	9	 |	Have the car follow a line on the ground	 |		 |
|	bonus	 |	Have the car follow a line on the ground and have it follow the line driving backwards	 |		 |
|	10	 |	Add an extra module/mechanical object to car and write the logic to move this along with car (think mechanical arm, shovel, propellor, etc)	 |		 |
|	bonus	 |	Get the new module/mechanical object to do something cool (like a get a mechanical arm to hold a pen and draw something 	 |		 |
|	11	 |	Have the car search for checkpoints in the room/area, and make a sound when it recognizes them (checkpoints can just be colors or specific objects)	 |		 |
|	bonus	 |	Then have the car output the number of checkpoints it found/passed with the LEDs	 |		 |
|	12	 |	Team up with another team (or 2) and get the cars to drive an identical pattern (bonus points to make it a pretty dance)	 |		 |
|	bonus	 |	The more cars join in, the more points	 |		 |
|	13	 |	Have the LED lights show the same color as an object on camera	 |	Done	 |
|	bonus	 |	Have it change color as you move the camera around the room	 |	Done	 |
|	14	 |	Add functionality to attach a joystick or other type of controller	 |		 |
|	bonus	 |	Use this controlller instead of the app during the competition on Thursday	 |		 |
|	15	 |	Implement functionality that allows a car to lock in on a target with the camera, and then continue to track it and follow it	 |		 |
|	bonus	 |	Have it try to catch up with the object it's following	 |		 |
|	16	 |	Car has to move down a straight line, every time a light flashes on, the car needs to come to standstill as fast as possible	 |	Done	 |
|	bonus	 |	Race with other cars that implemented their own version of this logic, and see who wins (winner gets the bonus points)	 |	Done	 |
|	17	 |	Add usb microphone for sound tracking. Every time you clap, it reverses direction	 |		 |
|	bonus	 |	USB microphone: very time "I wanna dance with somebody" comes on, it makes dance movements	 |		 |
|	18	 |	Obstacle avoidance: make sure it stops before all obstacles	 |		 |
|	bonus	 |	Obstacle avoidance: make sure it stops before all obstacles and then beeps twice	 |		 |
|	19	 |	Use fan to move balloon (blow one up), from point a to point z. We want to see at least 1 meter progress	 |		 |
|	bonus	 |	Use fan to do footbal tournament with other car, create 2 goals, 1 balloon, first team to make a goal wins points	 |		 |
|	20	 |	Use line tracker to detect when you reach straircase (slow down car for higher accuracy), have it stop before falling down stairs	 |	Done	 |
|	bonus	 |	Find a way to get down the stairs	 |	Done	 |
|	21	 |	Ramp detection: go outside and find tilted surface, get robot to detect ramp or slanted surface. If it detects slant, make it do a 180 degree turn and go up the ramp backwards	 |		 |
|	bonus	 |	Ramp detection part 2: have the car stand still half way, and auto-detect if it stards sliding down (wheels going backwards), to give enough power to stay in the same spot	 |		 |
|	22	 |	Face detection: find a face and have it beep twice	 |	Done	 |
|	bonus	 |	Face detection: find specific face to recognize (WHOSE FACE?) and have the fan start flowing and the beep go off 10x	 |		 |
